# Galton-Brett

## Project Overview

This web-based application allows students to conduct the Galton Board experiment online and compare their results. The Galton Board consists of a triangular grid of obstacles that randomly guide balls to the left or right, resulting in a binomial distribution of balls in the lower compartments.

## Features

- Simulate a Galton Board experiment
- Customize board configurations:
  - Number of rows
  - Number of balls
  - Probability of balls falling left or right
- Input predictions for ball distribution
- View simulation results in chart form
- Compare results with other users in the group

## Educational Value

This interactive tool provides students with a visual and engaging method to understand the theory of binomial distribution, making the learning process both exciting and effective.

## How It Works

1. Users set up the Galton Board configuration
2. Input predictions for ball distribution
3. Run the simulation
4. View and analyze results
5. Compare with other users' experiments

Experience the Galton Board experiment in a digital environment and enhance your understanding of probability and statistics!
